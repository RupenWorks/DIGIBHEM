Iris Classification Project

Overview
This project demonstrates a machine learning model for classifying iris species using the Iris dataset. The goal is to predict the species of an iris flower based on its features.

Dataset
The dataset used is the Iris dataset, which includes:

Features: Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width
Target: Iris species (Setosa, Versicolour, Virginica)


Technologies Used:

*Python
*jupyter
*Scikit-learn
*Pandas
*NumPy
*Matplotlib / Seaborn

Project Details
* Data Exploration: Analyzed and visualized the dataset to understand feature distributions and class separability.
* Data Preprocessing: Applied necessary preprocessing steps including scaling and splitting the data.
* Model Building: Implemented and evaluated various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
* Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Results: Presented model results and insights.
